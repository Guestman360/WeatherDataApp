# WeatherDataApp
A simple weather app I wrote in Swift 3, takes data from a weather API on the internet and makes use of JSON parsing to retrieve the data into a tableview. Can also use the users location.

Technologies used:
- Alamofire (3rd party library)
- openweatherdata.org, weather API
- parsing
- Tableview
- autolayout
- Corelocation
